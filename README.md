# zig-folio

A high-level Zig library for dead simple asynchronous I/O. The provided API should feel familiar to those transitioning from using Rust with Tokio.

This library is a wrapper around [zig-aio](https://github.com/Cloudef/zig-aio) which attempts to provide an intuitive API. Please show the developer of said project your support! Also, if you use this library, _always_ make issues here first so I can determine if it's a problem on our side or theirs.

**_When (and if) built-in async support for Zig returns, this project will not be ready._** It was written with the pessimistic assumption that it would be too difficult to bring back and will be dropped.
